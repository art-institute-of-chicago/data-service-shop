# Shop Data Service
> A slim API in front of our online shop

This service acts as a proxy to facilitate the flow of data from our [online shop](https://shop.artic.edu/) into our [data hub](https://github.com/art-institute-of-chicago?q=data). This API was built in-house and is maintained by in-house developers. It went to production in fall of 2018.
