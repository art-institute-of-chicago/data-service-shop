# Shop Data Service
> A slim API in front of our online shop

This service acted as a proxy to facilitate the flow of data from our [online shop](https://shop.artic.edu/) into our [data hub](https://github.com/art-institute-of-chicago?q=data). This API was built in-house and was maintained by in-house developers. It went to production in fall of 2018.

In September 2022, we made the decision to retire this API. Over the four years it was in service, its scope decreased to a point where it didn't make sense to maintain it as a separate system. Its functionality has been rolled into our [data aggregator](https://github.com/art-institute-of-chicago/data-aggregator). We retained this repository as a public archive.
